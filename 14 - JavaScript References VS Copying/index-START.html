    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3]= 'Lux';
    
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(team, players);
    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    team2[3]= 'Pax';
    console.log(players, team2);
    // one day

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = players.concat(players);
    team3[3]= 'Jax';
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3]= 'Lax';
    console.log(players,team4);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    let person = {
      name: 'matt',
      age: 100
    };
    // and think we make a copy:
    const person2 = person;
    person2.name = 'hefe';
    console.log(person, person2);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const person3 = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 99});
    //person3.name = 'Jorge';
    console.log(person, person3);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
